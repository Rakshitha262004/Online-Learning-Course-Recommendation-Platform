# 🧠 Recommendation Logic

The recommendation engine suggests courses based on:

* User Interests
* Selected Skills
* Course Tags
* Course Categories
* Excluding already enrolled courses

Example:

* User interested in AI → Recommend Machine Learning courses
* User interested in Web Development → Recommend MERN Stack courses
